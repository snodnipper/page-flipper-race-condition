Example to demonstrate how action bar options menu items do not always display.

This is possibly a race condition although I cannot comment as to whether there
is fundamentally something wrong with this code.

Menu items do not consistently display with this code regardless of the type of
view that is changing...something as simple as admob code breaks it.
